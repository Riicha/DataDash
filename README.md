Data Dash Incorporated

Data Dash Incorporated is a marketing consulting company that specializes in the mining of and analysis of social media data. In this case, we have compiled a dataset of possible influencers to present to our client. Through the Tweepy API and sentiment analysis, we have presented a list of potential spokespersons that have the most potential as influencers based on a combination of follower number, total tweets, and overall positivity. 

# Questions: 
# Who has the most followers?

# The influencer with the most followers is Katy Perry. With over 100 million, she has the largest audience to tweet to. 

# Who’s tweets have the most overall positive ratings from the public?

# Taylor Swift is the influencer with the most positive compound influence. With a compound sentiment of 0.38, her tweets are more positive than negative.

# What genre of influencers achieve the greatest influence?

In terms of number of followers, politicians are the most influential genre, but in terms of number of tweets, sports celebrities are the most influential. This could be due to the World Cup happening right now, which could explain the number of athletes’ tweets currently. With political tensions running high right now, as well as politics being a chronic hot topic, the fact that politicians have the most followers is no surprise. 

#  What types of trending hashtags are influential within these genres?

Based on current trends, hashtags that fall under the “social” category include #FamiliesBelongTogether, #MeToo, and #WeCare. For the hashtags that fall under the “entertainment” category, there is #SocialMediaDay, #WorldCup, and #FIFA. Though we have manually coded these hashtags for this phase, they were found based on the trending tweets on Twitter itself. Ideally, the way to find these tweet categories would be automated within the code. 

# Who are the top ten influencers based on the last year?

# The top ten influencers based on tweets are:
Noah Smith
Barkha Dutt
Jamie Mitchell
Harold Pollack
Cory Booker
Mark Thoma
Iliza Shiesinger
Iggy Azalea
Cris Cyborg
Jonathan Singer

# The top ten influencers based on followers are:
Katy Perry
Barack Obama
Taylor Swift
Lady Gaga
Ellen DeGeneres
Cristiano Ronaldo
Justin Timberlake
Britney Spears
Ariana Grande
Demi Lovato

The influencers with the most tweets tend to come from the economist or politician genre. Since both of these genres would be updating based on market trends, current events, news, or breaking stories, it makes sense that they would have the most tweets. Noah Smith has tweeted just over 140,000 times from his account, which is quite a large difference from Jonathan Singer, who has around 45,000 tweets. 

The influencers with the most followers tend to come from the Musician genre. This also makes sense considering how an influencer can tweet a part of a song, or an update about an album, which fans would absolutely want to know ASAP. Musicians also tend to be very popular, so even when tweeting about current events or opinions fans would want to know a little bit more about their “idols”. 

# Developed a Twitter Bot to retweet the tweets of the Celebrity or non celebrity influencers, whenever their tweet is alligned to the Missions, Goals, philanthropy etc of the Client (In this case it is a Pharma company) 

The bot looks for the hasgtags in the tweets of the Influencers.

# Conclusions
	
	Twitter is a popular and important tool in the modern marketplace. Companies use it advertise slogans, ideas, and products. In that vein, our goal was to compile a comprehensive analysis of some of the top tweeters to present to a client for their marketing use. The number of followers and potential influencer has does not directly correlate with the amount of tweets the influencer makes. Politicians and Sports Celebrities are the most popular genre of influencers, but this is heavily dependent on what is pertinent to the world in that moment. Trends are an important way to monitor the tone of Twitter and better project a successful launch window for a new product. 
	This information would be useful not just in the case of influencers, but entire brands of products, establishments, companies, or movements that have their own Twitter accounts.  We have also developed a bot that could be used to further the marketing campaign of our client. Through analyzing this data in real time, we can gather important information for businesses that could be necessary for figuring out the best way to advertise.
